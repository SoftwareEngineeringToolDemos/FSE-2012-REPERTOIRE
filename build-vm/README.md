This folder contains the files needed to build a virtual machine for REPERTOIRE using Vagrant.
***

#### Contents:

2. **bootstrap.sh**  - The script that will install all the requirements for the tool to run.

#### Requirements:

2. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
